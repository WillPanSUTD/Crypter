It's a group work:

We share our code and ideas here, upload in each folder. 

Can also read and modify other's work. 

Communicate in Whatsapp group.

Cheers!

latest update:
ReadNXOR.cpp: 

1) Make a random section of data in binary (using hashing if its large!)
2) Take in a file and convert to binary
3) Do XOR between file and random data to encrypt/decrypt file.
